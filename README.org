* Overview
  A program written in python to autogenerate a playlist in spotify with top tracks for the announced artists at Roskilde Festival 22.

* Setup
  In order to use the program you need to supply some credential through through either
  the cli, environmental variables, or a file called ~creds.json~ residing in the ~src~
  folder.  The three variables that has to be set are ~CLIENT_ID~, ~CLIENT_SECRET~, and
  ~REDIRECT_URI~. All of these can be found at
  [[https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications/<app_uri>]]

  an example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
      "client_id":"<client_id>",
      "client_secret":"<client_secret>",
      "redirect_uri":"https://localhost:8080",
      "playlist_uri":"<playlist_uri>"
  }
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
  The playlist generated has to be provided as an optional argument or set as an environment variable with ~export PLAYLIST_URI="<playlist_uri>"~. General usage is:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 $ python roskilde_bot.py -h
usage: roskilde_bot.py [-h] [-p [playlist-uri]] [-c [country]] [-n [n-tracks]]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p [playlist-uri], --playlist-uri [playlist-uri]
                        Playlist uri - not necessary if set as env-variable
  -c [country], --country [country]
                        Country to get top tracks from
  -n [n-tracks], --n-tracks [n-tracks]
                        Number of maximum tracks for each artist
